Alk is an executable algorithmic language. Its name is inspired from the name of the Persian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, where from the word "algorithm" is derived. The algorithms are executed over abstract data types like arrays, structures, cons lists (viewed as abstractions of simple linked lists).
